# Slider

Simple jQuery project. 
Project invovles 2+ images which fade in and out in 3 seconds. Images are also changed by using the "Previous" or "Next" buttons. 
When buttons are used, slider resets 3 second time in which images will automatically fade in and out.
If image is hover overed slider stops all together. Once the image is no longer being hovered the loop will start over its 3 second cylce.
